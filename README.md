# React Native Translator App

This is a React Native project for a Translator app, developed using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli). The app uses the Google Translator model, which is implemented in the `Backend` folder using Python and Flask.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

### Step 3: Set Up and Run the Backend

The Translator app uses a backend built with Python and Flask to integrate the Google Translator model. The backend code is located in the `Backend` folder.

#### Install Python Dependencies

Navigate to the `Backend` directory and install the required Python packages:

```bash
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start the Flask Server

After installing the dependencies, you can start the Flask server with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/`.

### Step 4: Modifying Your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes.

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native Translator App with a Python Flask backend. :partying_face:
